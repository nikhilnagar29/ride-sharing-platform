# Privacy Implementation in the Ride-Sharing Platform

This document explains how we implemented privacy (encapsulation) in the ride-sharing platform using Python conventions.

## Overview of Changes

We applied the following privacy principles:

1. We converted most public attributes to private (prefixed with underscore `_`)
2. We added properties (getters) to access these private attributes
3. We added setters only for attributes that need to be modified directly
4. We kept some attributes public where necessary (IDs and complex objects)

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Better Encapsulation**: Private attributes can't be accidentally modified from outside the class.
2. **Controlled Access**: Properties allow controlled access to the attributes.
3. **Future Flexibility**: We can add validation or additional logic in getters/setters without changing the interface.
4. **Improved Maintainability**: Clear separation between the internal state and external interface.

## Implementation Details

### User Classes

In the `User`, `Rider`, and `Driver` classes:

- We made attributes like `name`, `phone`, `current_location`, `rating`, etc. private by prefixing them with `_`.
- We added property getters for all these attributes.
- We added a property setter for `rating` since it needs to be directly modified in tests.
- We kept `id` as public since it's used for identification.
- We kept `vehicle` as a public attribute in `Driver` since it's a complex object often accessed directly.

### Ride Class

In the `Ride` class:

- We made all attributes private except for `id`.
- We added property getters for all attributes to ensure they can still be accessed.
- We added a property setter for `fare` since it needs to be set directly by the `RideManager`.
- We modified all internal methods to use the private attributes.

## Using Privacy in Python

In Python, privacy is implemented by convention rather than enforcement:

- Single underscore (`_attribute`): Indicates the attribute is intended for internal use only.
- Properties: Allow controlled access to private attributes through methods.
- Double underscore (`__attribute`): Triggers name mangling, making it harder to access from outside.

We chose to use single underscores as they provide a good balance between indicating privacy and allowing access when truly needed.

## Additional Considerations

1. We could have used double underscores (`__`) for stronger privacy, but this would make debugging and testing more difficult.
2. We made sure to update all references to the attributes in the methods.
3. We kept the public interface consistent so that existing code continues to work.
4. We added setters only when absolutely necessary to maintain encapsulation.

## Conclusion

By implementing these privacy changes, we've improved the design of the ride-sharing platform, making it more robust and easier to maintain in the future. The code is now better encapsulated, reducing the risk of accidental modifications and making it easier to modify internal implementations without affecting external code.
